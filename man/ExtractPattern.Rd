\usage{
ExtractPattern(text, pattern, margin = margin, ignoreCase = ignoreCase)
}
\arguments{
\item{text}{A list, arry or data frame of character vectors where matches are sought, or a list or array of objects which can be coerced by as.character to a character vector. Long vectors are supported.}

\item{pattern}{Character string containing a regular expression to be matched in the given character vector.
Coerced by as.character to a character string if possible.
If a character vector of length 2 or more is supplied, the first element is used with a warning. Missing values are allowed.
If the data frame contains more than one column, then the only first column is used.}

\item{margin}{a vector giving the subscripts which the CountPattern function will be applied over. E.g., for a matrix 1 indicates rows, 2 indicates columns, c(1, 2) indicates rows and columns. Where X has named dimnames, it can be a character vector selecting dimension names.}

\item{ignoreCase}{boolean to decide whether to ignore the case in searching the content in dictionary in the searchingData or not}
}
\value{
a list of integers showing the number frequency of the pattern match over columns and over rows
}
